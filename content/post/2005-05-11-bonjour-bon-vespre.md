Just how far can you travel in a week and a half? It turns out pretty far.
Combining planes, trains, ships, and automobiles, Yasuko and I travelled, all
told, roughly 22,100 km over the Golden Week holiday.  
  
  
From Tokyo to Avignon, on to Marseille, then Arles and Nîmes, followed by
Carcassonne, Perpignan, and Barcelona, before heading back to Paris and home to
Tokyo in 12 days wasn't bad… Especially considering the car was a Fiat.
