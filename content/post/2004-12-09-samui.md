With the last days of 2004 upon us, it appears the weather has taken a turn
from the relative warmth of November and December to plummet sub-zero
overnight. What started as a light flurry this morning has progressed to a
full-out blizzard, and it’s still coming down like crazy as I write
this.<!--more-->

In unrelated news, I’m off to Kyoto for Oshogatsu from the 31st to the 3rd.
This time, I swear I’ll post pictures!

Hope everyone had a happy Christmas. See you in 2005!
