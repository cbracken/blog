今年も宜しくお願いします！Jumped on the Nozomi Shinkansen from Shin-Yokohama
station on the 31st to arrive in Kyoto two hours later. It was dumping snow
from Nagoya onwards; and by the time we hit Kyoto, about 10 cm had
accumulated.<!--more-->

After stopping by friends’ for the traditional osechi-ryouri and soba dinner,
Yasuko and I did hatsumoude at Yasaka shrine from 11 at night until 2 in the
morning in the midst of the blizzard.

Spent the next few days shopping in Kyoto, visiting more friends, and
re-visiting shrines and temples before heading back to Tokyo on the 3rd—though
on the return trip, I had to stand from Nagoya onwards since the trains were
booked to 120%.
