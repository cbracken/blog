How many police does it take to catch a monkey in one of Tokyo's busiest train
stations? Apparently a lot more than the [40 or so that
tried][yt_monkey_at_shibuya].<!--more-->

The monkey was first spotted around 9:45am on top of the Tokyu Toyoko Line
schedule display, possibly one of the best choices for people-watching in
Shibuya Station, strategically positions between the exit of the Tokyu
department store and the entrance to one of Tokyo's busiest train lines.  
  
It hung around for close to two hours while commuters, shoppers, news crews and
a posse of net-wielding cops showed up, before finally deciding to [make a
break for it][yt_news]. Police never did catch the cheeky monkey, and its
current whereabouts are unknown.

Apparently this is the third incident of a monkey getting into a train station
in Tokyo in the last few weeks.
