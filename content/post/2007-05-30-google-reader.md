For years, I've been a fan of [Brent Simmons'][inessential] OS X-based feed
reader, [NetNewsWire][nnw]. It's a fantastic application, and I've definitely
got my money's worth out of it. After partnering with [NewsGator][newsgator], I
started using their online feed-reader on and off, with mixed
results. I like that it keeps my feeds in sync between my computers,
and that I can browse articles at lunch, but the interface is still not on par
with NetNewsWire itself.<!-- more -->

While NewsGator's implementation was lacking, I really did like the idea of
dropping the desktop app altogether and going with a fully online solution, so
I started exploring other options. The obvious free alternative is [Google
Reader][google_reader], and I have to say, I'm impressed. While the
presentation isn't as customizable as NetNewsWire, the functionality that I use
is all there, and in fact, it has some extra search features that I miss on the
desktop. It was only when I launched NetNewsWire today and saw 290 unread
items, that it hit me I hadn't used it in almost a month. So while I look
forward to [NetNewsWire 3][nnw3], I'm sticking to Google Reader for the time
being.

I also discovered that my prime news reading hours are apparently 6:30am to
7:30am and 9pm to 11pm, with a strange local maximum straggling out around
12:30am. I'd be curious to compare this to *before* I had a baby that woke me
up around that time.

*Update (2007-06-06):* NetNewsWire 3.0 is now out.
