*Update (2009-02-28)*: Alright, guilty as charged. "No wireless. Less space than
a nomad. [Lame](https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/Apple-releases-iPod).

After watching the Steve Jobs iPhone keynote, I have to say I'm a little
disappointed. While this phone has a slicker GUI than any other phone I've
seen, it's not so much the $499 US price-tag, but the stone-age functionality
of the phone compared to what we have here in Japan that makes my jaw
drop.<!--more-->

Here in Japan, 3 years ago in 2004, for 1 yen, I had the following in a
cellphone:

* 3G download speeds of 50 Mb/s.
* Two-way video-phone.
* Built-in fingerprint scanner (for security checks).
* MP3 player and download service.
* Edy BitWallet (like Interac, except you swipe your finger on the
  phone's scanner to accept the transaction).
* Can be used as a *Suica* train pass.
* Can buy movie tickets and scan in at the theatre, bypassing the
  lineup.
* Can wave it at vending machines for food and drinks.
* Will figure out train routes, transfer locations and times, and
  ticket prices.
* Can scan barcodes which take you to websites – eg. scan at the bus
  station to pull up the schedule or scan a magazine to order a
  product.
* MP3 player and download service.
* Decent email (+ attachments), SMS, calendaring, notepad.
* Automatic location triangulation (by determining which antennae are
  nearby) and location-aware mapping, shopping/restaurant listings.
* Interactive mapping of current location with zooming and scrolling.
* Integrated graphical web-browser.
* 1 megapixel Camera, Video camera.
* Display/graph your phone usage to the day.
* Can write and deploy your own Java/C/C++ applets.

If you go for a high-end phone with more than the above (e.g. built-in TV
tuner), you'll need to pay more than one yen, but the price range is normally
below ¥20,000 ($200 Canadian). In its current state, the iPhone won't sell in
Japan even if it's free; Apple is going to have to do some major work if it
wants to compete with even the bare-bones models on the market in Japan.
