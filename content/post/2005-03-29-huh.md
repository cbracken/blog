As I stared blankly out the window of the train on my morning commute,
something caught my eye. As the train flew along its raised track, whizzing
past the rooftops of Gakugei-daigaku at 80&nbsp;km/h, I swear I saw a guy
standing on the roof of a building alongside the track, dressed in a red cape
and wearing a giant fish on his head, wailing away on a guitar.<!--more-->

He was gone from my view before I was able to catch a second glance, though.

*Update (2008-03-20):* I’m glad he’s [not just a figment of my imagination][article].
