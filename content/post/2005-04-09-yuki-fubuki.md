Last weekend, the temperature shot up to 23 degrees, and in the space of two
days, the cherry blossom trees erupted into bloom. The Japanese take this
opportunity to throw impromptu picnics, dinners, and random sake-drinking
events under [sakura][wiki_sakura] trees all across the country.<!--more-->

The street behind my building is lined with sakura for as far as you can walk,
so it’s been packed with everyone in the neighbourhood until almost midnight
every night this week. With the cherry blossoms falling like snow since this
morning, the whole thing will be over with by early next week, so Yasuko and I
plan to get in one last hana-mi event tomorrow evening before heading back to
work on Monday.
