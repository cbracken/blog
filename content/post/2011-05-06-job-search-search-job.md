After close to seven fantastic years with [Morgan Stanley][ms], I've turned in
my badge and exited world of finance.<!--more--> I first joined Morgan in Tokyo
in 2004 working in the Equities Technology group focusing on scalability in the
trade processing plant, and later worked in Montréal and Vancouver in equities
and commodities technology. Throughout my career with Morgan Stanley, I've had
the pleasure of working alongside a lot of incredibly bright people on some
very interesting and challenging problems, mainly focusing on scalability,
parallelism and system architecture.

After being made the offer one sunny Kyoto morning, and giving it some serious
contemplation, I've accepted a position with [Google][goog] in [Mountain View,
California][mtv_map]. While there's no question I'll miss working with all the
people who made my time at Morgan Stanley such an awesome experience, I'm
excited about joining Google, and looking forward to working on some tough and
interesting problems in a very unique environment.
