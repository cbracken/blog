According to [Slashdot][slashdot_article], this month the [Apple
II][wiki_appleii] turns 30. It was in production for 18 of those 30 years,
which likely makes it the longest-selling personal computer of all time. It was
the computer I wrote my first program on, and spent countless hours banging in
and editing code from _Compute_ magazine—including page after page of raw hex
code when a program included graphics.<!--more-->

In tribute, I ran a Google search on PR\#6 to see what turned up. For those who
don't know or don't remember, PR\#6 was the command that kicked off the
bootloader code for slot 6, the drive controller. The search turned up two
relevant links: an [Apple TechTip][techtip] on a simple copy-protection scheme,
and a fantastic [blog entry][appleii_boot] that covers a bit about the Apple
\]\['s boot process, which brings back a lot of memories of old Shugart drives,
including the terrifying sound of a track 0 seek – a process wherein the drive
head was moved across the disk very quickly until it physically couldn't go any
further, resulting in a loud alarm-like buzz from the drive when it hit the
limit of its reach.

Anyway, in celebration of the Apple \]\['s 30th birthday, I recommend grabbing
your nearest [emulator][emulator], and banging in a `call -151` for old time's
sake.
