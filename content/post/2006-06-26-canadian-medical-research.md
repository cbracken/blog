Don't let anyone tell you that Canada never contributed groundbreaking research
to the medical field. First, the discovery and isolation of insulin by
researchers at the University of Toronto; now [this paper][1] published in the
British Medical Journal, co-authored by a Grade 8 student from Hamilton,
Ontario.
