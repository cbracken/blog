Through a stroke of luck, I think I may have actually found a permanent place
to live in Jiyugaoka close to Toritsu Daigaku station.<!--more-->

I have my current apartment in Ebisu until the 30th, so the plan is to move the
weekend of the 27th. In the meantime, to placate people asking for pictures,
hereâ€™s the view from my balcony here in Ebisu. The upside is that Ebisu is an
incredibly central location in Tokyo with a ton of great restaurants; the
downside is that tea costs 735 yen at the coffee shop across the way.
