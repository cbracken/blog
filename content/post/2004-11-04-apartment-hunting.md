title: Apartment Hunting
---

Through a stroke of luck, I think I may have actually found a permanent place
to live in Jiyugaoka close to Toritsu Daigaku station.<!--more-->

I have my current apartment in Ebisu until the 30th, so the plan is to move the
weekend of the 27th. In the meantime, to placate people asking for pictures,
here’s the view from my balcony here in Ebisu. The upside is that Ebisu is an
incredibly central location in Tokyo with a ton of great restaurants; the
downside is that tea costs 735 yen at the coffee shop across the way.
