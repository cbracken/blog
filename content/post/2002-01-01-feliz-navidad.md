Took a two week trip through southern México for Christmas. Starting in Mérida,
southwest into Campeche, Tabasco, Veracruz and then Chiapas.<!--more--> Stopped
to visit the Mayan ruins at Palenque, followed by some of the villages around
San Cristóbal de las Casas. From there, it was northeast back onto the Yucatán
peninsula, to Tulúm, then onwards north again to spend Christmas swimming in
the Caribbean on Isla Mujeres in 30 degree weather. After a few days, it was
westward again to Chichen Itzá and Valladolid before finally returning home to
Mérida.
