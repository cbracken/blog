title: 結婚してくれますか？

The big news is that Yasuko and I will be getting married in November at
Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto. For the desperately curious, I 'officially' proposed
in February at *Souvenir*, a French restaurant down the street.<!--more-->
  
In Japan, getting engaged isn't strictly just proposing. You're really not
truly engaged until you've 'officially' proposed, which means not just deciding
to get married, but getting together with the finacées parents and proposing to
them. A long time ago, one might typically say *O-jou-san o boku ni kudasai.*
"Please give me your [honourable] daughter." I decided I'd pass on that line.
  
In any case, after a few trips back and forth to Kyoto, we settled on a
Japanese ceremony just before noon, followed by a party with friends and family
at a restaurant. The *nijikai* party in Tokyo will be western-style, but we
haven’t even begun to think about when or where yet.
  
For those questioning the sanity of a November wedding, keep in mind that in
Japan, this is *kōyō* season, when all the leaves turn red and Japan is at its
most beautiful. As Fall and Spring are the two most beautiful seasons in Japan,
we were lucky to reserve when we did, back in April. Even then, some
restaurants we talked to were already booked solid until mid-December.  
  
In any case, with the shrine and restaurant out of the way, all we have left to
figure out is wedding rings, kimonos, invitations, flowers, food, gifts,
speeches, photos, ...
