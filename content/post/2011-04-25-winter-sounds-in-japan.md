title: Winter Sounds in Japan
---

There are a lot of uniquely Japanese sounds.  But the two I'm writing
about today appear on cold winter nights, and echo eerily through the
dark, empty streets between dinner and bedtime.<!--more-->

Japanese winters are cold. They're not -30C cold, but what they do have on
Canadian winters is how drafty Japanese houses tend to be, and the distinct
lack of central heating. All across the country the appearance of convenience
store oden and yaki-imo wagons mark the arrival of winter.

Yaki-imo are sweet potatoes roasted over flames in wood fired ovens in small
mobile carts or trucks.  They're served up wrapped in newspaper, and are not
only delicious, but keep your hands warm too.  But the most distinctive thing
about yaki-imo is that the sellers sing a very distinct [yaki-imo
song][yt_yakiimo]. They typically make the rounds until just after dinner time,
and I always found their song a bit eerie drifting though the dark streets.

Central heating is near non-existent in Japan, one result of which is the
[kotatsu][wiki_kotatsu], but another is that kerosene and gas heaters are still
commonly used for heating.  Every year, housefires result from people
forgetting to shut of their heaters before bed.  As a reminder to shut off the
heaters, people walk through town late at night, carrying lanterns and clacking
wooden blocks together, calling out "[hi no yōjin][yt_hinoyoujinn]": be careful
with fire.  The sound of the blocks typically carries for many blocks, and you
often hear their calls echoing through town, coming and going for up to half an
hour as you lay in bed.
